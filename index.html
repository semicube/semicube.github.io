          This part is pretty simple. You just need to choose which version of the software you want to use. Here is my list at the time of writing:

          Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a
          paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality,
          though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A
          paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and
          Connors 115). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.
          For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just
          one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main
          idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what
          happens in the rest of the paragraph.
